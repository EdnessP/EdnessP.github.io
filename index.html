        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <p>I've had a few sites in the past, but none of them really had any meaningful use, nor did they look nice. While I've wanted to make this site for a while now, I wanted it to actually have some useful and/or interesting purpose besides just categorizing all of my currently published scripts and plugins.
        <p>And that said purpose ended up being the <a href="/live">Live Tools</a> section, where I attempted to learn and improve my JavaScript and find out why it's so widely disliked by rewriting some of the more simpler scripts for a live web version ready to play around with. (Seriously, 53-bit precision integers and no direct way to have unsigned numbers?)
        <p>This site relies on Bootstrap and jQuery which are imported from jsDelivr.com, but besides that no other libraries were used. Everything else you see here was hand-written, and the sources can be found at <a href="https://github.com/EdnessP/EdnessP.github.io">the site's repository</a>.
        <p>For my currently published scripts, see the <a href="/tools">Tools and Plugins</a> section; to read a bit more about myself, see the <a href="/about">About Me</a> section. I also accept <a href="/donate">donations</a>.
